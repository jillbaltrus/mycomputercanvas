      "Artist Mood Ring is a fun application for users to search any artist on Spotify and see an analysis of their top tracks' characteristics. I built this app using plain JavaScript, Bootstrap and Express. It utilizes Spotify's API to search artists by name, retrieve their top 10 tracks, and retrieve the qualitative scores for each of those songs. It then aggregates them into a single score for each metric, to be displayed on the UI.",

Then I selected a rectangle next to her fingertip and shifted it left, to make it look like it was sliding back. I had to do some surgery, so to speak, to blend the surrounding area and make it look normal.",

      "Turtle Hub is a React application I'm building on a 3-person team to manage our sorority's calendar. This application will be used to create, discover and RSVP to events. In addition, each member will have their own account and public profile in order to help manage attendance. In addition to the React application, we also built a Node.js server to handle HTTP requests that operate on event and user data, such as creating or deleting an event, RSVPing or un-RSVPing from an event, registering for a new account, or updating a profile. We're using a MongoDB NoSQL database with the Mongoose ODM to store and manage our data. The Node server acts as the middleman between our database and React application's services, communicating through HTTP requests. In addition, we're integrating the Google Maps API into the application to plot event locations on an interactive map. This project has been a lot of fun and allowed me to work on all areas on the tech stack, which I really enjoy! We're aiming to wrap this project up by Fall 2023.",

The game consists of 3 distinct levels, each with their own distinct goal and setting from the Harry Potter universe. We also included some interactions with beloved characters, including Dumbledore, Hagrid and Voldemort himself. We developed 25 C# scripts to control game logic and mechanics, including finite state machine behavior and transitions for NPCs. We also incorporated background music, sound effects, visual effects, and both custom and public assets and models to create an immersive and engaging gameplay experience.
